<h1>Youth Group </h1>

<h1>My Favorite Way to Spend Time </h1>

<p> 	I am involved in 3 churches. I go to my moms, dads, and my best friend Morgans. And i'm involved with each of their youth groups. If i’m not at school, more than likely I am doing something with a youth group. I’m never available on wednesdays, and a lot of my weekends consist of retreats, or charity work. </p>


<p> 	The youth groups I am involved in have some pretty sick names. The first one is “Crave” at Brookwood church. I have been going there since i’ve been very little, so the friends i have there are very special to my heart. The second one is “Overflow” at The Well, I go there with my mom. The church actually just got its own building last year. Lastly is “Vapor” at Fellowship Greenville. I go there with my best friend Morgan. All of these youth groups are super awesome, and you are going to get to know why. </p>

<h1>The Camps and Awesome Friends </h1>


<p> 	The camps and retreats I go on with these groups are absolutely life changing. There were a few that have really left a place in my heart. The first one is called “Seesalt”, I went there with “Overflow”. I’ve been going to that camp with them for 4 years now, and it gets better and better each year. It’s located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and we are right on the beach. But this year when I went, one of my best friends that have had a really bad year  from falling into temptations. She turned her life around at camp that week. And I don’t think I have ever cried so much,just for being so happy for someone else. The other camp is called “High School Camp”, I went there with “Crave”. The camp trades off locations from Tennesse to Florida. Every Night and morning there are these beautiful and freaking awesome worship services. When you are in there with 2,000 other jesus loving teenagers. It just kind of gets to you, and you have never felt so happy in your life. </p> 


<p> 	Lastly I want to talk about the friends and relationships I have gained. Some of my closest friends that I tell everything to are in my youth groups. And I have some great bonds where they will never be broken. I am so blessed to be apart of the amazing groups, and to have people I can trust to talk to. I love being apart of this, and I hope one day I could be a leader for a youth group, and see other people's life change. </p>
